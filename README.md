# MSP430-Codes
Bare Metal programming codes for Texas Instruments' MSP430G2553 coded using Texas Instruments' Code Composer Studio (CCS) IDE

I've also provided the HEX based output along with the Proteus project & Execution screenshot of these codes!

Note: The HEX file is supposed to be imported into the proteus simulation for the simulated output to be obtained.

Hope you find these helpful!
Happy learning!
Thanks!
